## What is it?

Well it is an experiment with walking tank I posted on unity forums, once upon a time. Go to Scenes, open either Scene (`SampleScene` or `Walker2Scene`) and press play. And there you go.

## Warning

This is unfinished. I haven't cracked the walking sequence completely, but somebody was interested in sources so I put them onto github.

## Controls.

`SampleScene` cannot be controller. The tank moves in fixed sequence and does not respond to the environment.
`Walker2Scene` can be controller. Turn around with mouse and move with WSAD. The tank will (slowly) turn to look in same direction as camera, and will slowly walk in direction specified with
WSAD keys. Actually gamepad will also work. Be aware that it is extremely easy to get launched into orbit and flip over.

Have fun.
